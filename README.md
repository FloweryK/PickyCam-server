# Focus-on-You

### WARNING

- Right now, face detection is not working as `face_detection` library does not support Windows environment, and I'm running server on Windows. I'll soon find a way to deal with this.
- This repo is still on development. 



### How to Install

I strongly recommend you to work inside a virtual environment.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```



### How to Run Test

```
$ python serve_model.py --video {videopath}
```
